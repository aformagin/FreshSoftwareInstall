# FreshSoftwareInstall

I am creating this software installer to make it a lot quicker for me to install all of the software I need to get back up and running in the event of a system failure. 


Current software that is downloaded and installed:
Android-Studio
Discord
Minecrat-Launcher
Jetbrains-toolbox
spotify

& more when I get around to finishing up the list and figuring out what can be installed with pacman
